Task A - straight forward pre-processing of data to be ready for the analysis. 
Task B - 
1. Distribution of word types: I would want clarification on this, I guess the lecturer means verbs, nouns etc by word types?
2. From above, each category would have a distribution of words, could visually compare to see which categories are similar, 
and/or use cosine similarity to get a metric, telling us the similarity of words used in each topic.
3. This is just the distribution of word types (and phrases) across the whole dataset.
4, 5. 6. This is counting the frequency/average number of mentions, hashtags of each group.

Task C - 
This involves matching up the data from each category to a lexicon. For a simple example, we see what frequency of words are negative/neural/positive and give them a sentiment score (for example, a tweet with score 20 would contain mainly positive words, a tweet with -20 would contain mainly negative ones).
From this we can give a sentiment score to each group to see if they're positive/neural/negative (and we can split these 3 feelings into more groups, not just pos/neg/neutral).

Task D - Text classifier
We classify the groups we believe are info/misinfo.
We train the model (simple case is a logistic regression), to see what words and phrases are associated with info and misinfo.
We can then take a new tweet if that tweet has a lot of words that are related to info, we would say that is an informative tweet.
If it has a lot of words associated with misinformation, we can predict that tweet to be a tweet of misinformation.
